Project Description (1-2 pages):
The aim of this project is to model a virtual ant colony in which the ants behave like real life ants in which they carry out various 
activities vital to the colony such as collecting food, removing rubbish, defending the colony, looking after the young and building the colony. 
Ants leave a pheromone trail behind them which indicates the activity they are involved in. If an Ant detects many of the same activity it 
will decide to switch to an activity that has fewer ants and thus naturally maintain equality throughout all activities. 
Theoretically the whole system will be self-organising and complex structures should emerge after leaving the 
simulation running potentially overnight or over the course of a few days. 

There will be different types of ants which will choose between a set of jobs completable by certain ants. 
Scout ants will search an area for food and other resources valuable to the colony. Worker ants will carry 
those resources to the colony to be used in a variety of manners. Worker ants will also look after the 
colony’s young and maintain the state of the colony. Soldier ants will defend the colony from foreign ants 
who may choose to invade. Drone ants will be spawned to mate and replenish the numbers in the colony. 
The queen ant is the centre of the colony and ultimately is the heart of the colony, she produces the eggs which will 
replenish the population of the colony. Unfertilized eggs produce male Drone ants, fertilized eggs may produce a wide range of ants.

An element to be considered for the artificial intelligence controlling the individual ants is the ability to “evolve” or 
adapt to new situations such as an increase or decrease in food. This would allow them to continue to operate at maximum 
efficiency despite the change in environment. This will probably involve creating an in depth neural network with the ability to 
decide which tasks to perform based on counting the pheromone trails left by other ants.
